# Vehicle_Simulation
submission 2 for jr programmer pathway

I use some assets from "Create With Code" course to create a simulation of the movements of some vehicles. 

Car: can only move on land, has the lowest speed
Boat: can only move on water, has medium speed.
Plane: can move freely on any tiles, has the fastest speed.
